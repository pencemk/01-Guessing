# 01-Guessing
My very first game i have ever created! 
This is my first game I have created. This was for my C220 Game Design class at Indiana University. This game allows you to attempt to guess a random number between 1-100. Using control structures and simple data types, the player can repeatedly guess a randomly generated interger. Along the way, hints such as "too high" can be found in order to help get the player closer to the random number. This game also tracks how many attempts the player takes.
